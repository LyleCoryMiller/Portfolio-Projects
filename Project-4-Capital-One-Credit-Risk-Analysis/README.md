## Objectives 🎯
- Analyze repayment behavior and key risk indicators
- Identify customer segments with higher default probability
- Help credit teams make informed lending decisions

---

## Tools Used 🛠️
- **Excel** – Data cleaning and preparation
- **SQL** – Risk segmentation and repayment trend analysis
- **Power BI** – Dashboard creation for risk visualization

---

## Key Insights 📈
- **Default Rate**: ~22% of customers defaulted on payments
- **High Risk Factors**: Customers with payment delay codes (PAY_0 >= 2)
- **Age Group**: Customers around 73 years had the highest default rate (75%)
- **Credit Limits** Higher limits generally lowered default risk, but some high-credit customers still defaulted

## Conclusion & Recommendations 💡
- **Target Age & Repayment Risk**: Monitor age groups with high risk and repeated late payments
- **Refine Credit Strategies**: Align credit limits with repayment history to manage exposure
- **Implement Early Intervention**: Use PAY_0 flags to trigger proactive outreach
