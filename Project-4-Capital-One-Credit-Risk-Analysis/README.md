## Conclusion & Recommendations üí°
- **Target Age & Repayment Risk**: Monitor age groups with high risk and repeated late payments.
- **Refine Credit Strategies**: Align credit limits with repayment history to manage exposure.
- **Implement Early Intervention**: Use PAY_0 flags to trigger proactive outreach.
- **Automate Risk Flagging**: Use SQL conditions to dynamically flag high-risk customers in real time. This enables credit teams to prioritize early intervention and integrate risk signals into BI dashboards.

## Final Thoughts üìù
This project demonstrates essential skills for **CRM Specialists**, **Business Analysts**, and **Risk Analysts** by transforming credit repayment data into actionable insights. It supports predictive decisions through structured SQL queries and a professional Power BI dashboard.
