This project analyzes international logistics capabilities based on the World Bank's Logistics Performance Index (LPI). It highlights year-over-year trade efficiency trends and regional infrastructure gaps using SQL and Power BI.

---

## 📌 Objectives
- Evaluate global logistics infrastructure performance from 2010 to 2023
- Identify countries with the strongest and weakest logistics scores
- Recommend regional improvements for trade optimization

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Excel** – Data preparation and formatting
- **SQL** – Segmentation and country scoring trends
- **Power BI** – Dashboard reporting and LPI visualization

---

## 📌 Key Insights
- **Top performers**: Germany, Singapore, Netherlands led in infrastructure & customs
- **Bottom performers**: Chad, Afghanistan, Somalia faced chronic inefficiencies
- **LPI Global Trend**: Overall improvement in LPI from 2010 to 2023
- **Customs & Timeliness** were most volatile dimensions year-over-year
