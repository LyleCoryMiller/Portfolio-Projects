# 📌  Project 4 – Capital One Credit Risk Analysis

This project simulates how Capital One might evaluate the likelihood of customer default based on repayment history, credit limits, and demographics. SQL and Power BI were used to build insights that support risk mitigation strategies in consumer lending.

---

## 📌 Objectives
- Analyze repayment behavior and key risk indicators
- Identify customer segments with higher default probability
- Help credit teams make informed lending decisions

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Excel** – Data cleaning and preparation
- **SQL** – Risk segmentation and repayment trend analysis
- **Power BI** – Dashboard creation for risk visualization

---

## 📌 Key Insights
- **Default Rate**: ~22% of customers defaulted on payments
- **High Risk Factors**: Customers with payment delay codes (PAY_0 >= 2)
- **Age Group**: Customers around 73 years had the highest default rate (75%)
- **Credit Limits** Higher limits generally lowered default risk, but some high-credit customers still defaulted

## 📌 Conclusion & Recommendations
- **Target Age & Repayment Risk**: Monitor age groups with high risk and repeated late payments
- **Refine Credit Strategies**: Align credit limits with repayment history to manage exposure
- **Implement Early Intervention**: Use PAY_0 flags to trigger proactive outreach
