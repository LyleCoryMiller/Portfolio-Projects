# 📌 Project 4 – Credit Risk & Default Prediction

This project evaluates the likelihood of customer default based on repayment history, credit limit, and demographics. SQL and Power BI were used to build insights supporting risk mitigation strategies.

---

## 📌 Objectives
- Analyze repayment behavior and key risk indicators
- Identify customer segments with higher default probability
- Help credit teams make informed lending decisions

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Excel** – Data cleaning and preparation
- **SQL** – Risk segmentation and repayment trend analysis
- **Power BI** – Dashboard creation for risk visualization

---

## 📌 Key Insights
- **Default Rate**: ~22% of customers defaulted on payments
- **High Risk Factors**: Customers with payment delay codes (PAY_0 >= 2)
- **Age Group 30-40** had highest number of defaults
- **Low Credit Limits** linked to lower default amounts, not necessarily lower risk

## 📌 Conclusion & Recommendations
- **Target Age & Repayment Risk**: Monitor age 30-40 and those with repeated late payments
- **Refine Credit Strategies**: Align credit limits with repayment history to manage exposure
- **Implement Early Intervention**: Use PAY_0 flags to trigger proactive outreach
